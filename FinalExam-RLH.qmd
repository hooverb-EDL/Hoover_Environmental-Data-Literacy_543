abstract: "This study examines the factors affecting sex ratios in Sonoran bark beetle (*Araptus attenuatus*) populations, focusing on habitat suitability, phenotypic traits, and historical climate conditions. We found significant variation in sex ratios across multiple locations, yet no site deviated from the expected 1:1 male-to-female ratio. A negative correlation between habitat suitability and sex ratio suggests that females prefer higher-quality habitats. Including phenotypic traits—Phenotype A and B—improved our model's predictive power. We compared current habitat suitability to historical data from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and discovered significant changes over time. Our predictions of historical sex ratios correlated with LGM suitability. Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated that predicted sex ratios were spatially clustered, likely due to shared environmental factors. These findings enhance our understanding of how habitat and climate shape *A. attenuatus* population dynamics, with implications for forest management and pest control in pine forests affected by bark beetle outbreaks."

## 1. Introduction

The Sonoran bark beetle (*Araptus attenuatus*) is a significant pest in North American pine forests, playing a key role in forest dynamics by infesting and killing trees. Males seek out newly senescing stems of Pinus species, such as Pinus lomellii, to hollow out chambers for habitation. They produce a pheromone to attract females for reproduction, but remain stationary once settled. In contrast, females are more mobile and tend to travel farther, suggesting that female preference and mobility are crucial in shaping sex ratios within populations.

Habitat suitability is an important factor influencing these sex ratios, with the "better neighborhood hypothesis" suggesting that females prefer habitats conducive to reproduction. Thus, sites with higher suitability may display lower sex ratios, indicating more females per male.

This study also explores how historical climate change, particularly during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) about 20,000 years ago, may have affected species distributions and sex ratios. By comparing current habitat suitability with reconstructions from the LGM, we can better understand how past climate shifts influenced population structures.

We aim to determine whether sex ratios vary across sites, how habitat suitability is related to these ratios, and the potential influence of phenotypic traits. Additionally, we will consider how historical changes in habitat suitability impacted *A. attenuatus* sex ratios during the LGM.

## 2. Methods

To investigate variations in the sex ratio of the Sonoran bark beetle (SB) across sampled populations and their potential environmental drivers, we calculated sex ratios for each site by aggregating individual beetle data. We used binomial tests to check for deviations from an equal male-to-female ratio (50:50) and performed an ANOVA to assess whether the sex ratio differed significantly between sites. A stacked bar plot was created to visualize the sex distribution across sites.

We then examined the relationship between the sex ratio and habitat suitability by extracting suitability values from a 1.0 km² raster layer representing current conditions. These values were combined with sex ratio estimates, and Pearson's correlation was used to analyze their relationship.

We also tested whether the inclusion of phenotypic traits (Phenotype A and Phenotype B) improved the predictive power of habitat suitability for the sex ratio. Two linear models were compared: one with only habitat suitability as the predictor and another with both habitat suitability and phenotypic traits. Model performance was assessed using AIC values, F-statistics, and R-squared values to determine which model best explains the data.

To assess historical habitat suitability changes, we compared current suitability values with those from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using a suitability raster for the LGM. Changes in suitability were visualized on an interactive map, and spatial autocorrelation was tested using Moran’s I to assess spatial patterns in suitability shifts.

Finally, we applied the model incorporating current habitat suitability and phenotypic data to predict historical sex ratios based on LGM estimates. The predicted sex ratios were mapped to assess whether shifts aligned with regional climate and habitat suitability differences.

Model diagnostics are crucial for validating our findings. Although we focused on model comparisons, examining residuals using plot(model_3) helps check assumptions like linearity, homoscedasticity (constant variance), and normality. This assessment ensures reliable conclusions about the relationships between sex ratios, habitat suitability, and phenotypic traits.

## 3. Results

The results of this study are organized into key sections addressing sex ratios of Sonoran bark beetle populations, habitat suitability, phenotypic traits, and changes over time.

### 3.1. Sex Ratios Across Sites

We examined sex ratios at each sampling site through aggregated beetle data. ANOVA results showed significant variation in sex ratios across sites (p = 0.00307), indicating notable differences by location. A stacked bar plot (Figure 1) illustrates this variation in sex distribution.

### 3.2. Deviations from an Equal Male-to-Female Ratio

Binomial tests revealed no significant deviations from a 1:1 male-to-female ratio at any site, with all p-values exceeding 0.05. This indicates that overall, sex ratios were approximately equal across sites.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(gt)
library(dplyr)

# Check if there's data
if (nrow(deviation_sites) == 0) {
  deviation_sites <- tibble(Site = "No Sites", Deviation = "No Significant Deviation")
}

  ) %>%
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "No significant deviation detected in the available sites."
  )



```

### 3.3. Habitat Suitability and Sex Ratio

We analyzed the relationship between habitat suitability and sex ratios by merging data from a 1.0 km² raster. A Pearson's correlation showed a significant negative relationship (r = -0.37, p = 0.04717), suggesting that higher habitat suitability corresponds to lower mean sex ratios, as confirmed by a scatter plot (Figure 2).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Question 3

       x = "Habitat Suitability", y = "Mean Sex Ratio") +
  theme_minimal()

```

### 3.4. Impact of Phenotypic Traits

We compared two linear regression models: one with only habitat suitability and another that included phenotypic traits (Phenotype A and B). Including the traits improved the model fit (Model 2: AIC = -7678.54 vs. Model 1: AIC = -7630.36), and ANOVA results were highly significant (p = 4.848e-12), indicating a notable contribution of phenotypic traits to the variation in sex ratios.

### 3.5. Changes in Habitat Suitability Since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)

We analyzed changes in habitat suitability from the LGM to the present by comparing LGM suitability data with current values, visualized on an interactive leaflet map (Figure 3). Variations showed both increases and decreases in suitability, providing insights into the impact of climate change on habitat for Sonoran bark beetles.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Question 5

# Figure 6
leaflet(locations_clean) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addCircleMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude, 
    radius = 6,  
    color = ~colorNumeric("RdYlBu", Change_in_Suitability)(Change_in_Suitability),  
    stroke = FALSE,  
    fillOpacity = 0.8,  
    popup = ~paste("Site:", Site, "<br>",
                   "Change in Suitability:", Change_in_Suitability) 
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    position = "bottomright",  
    pal = colorNumeric("RdYlBu", locations_clean$Change_in_Suitability),  
    values = locations_clean$Change_in_Suitability,  
    title = "Change in Suitability"
  ) %>%
  setView(lng = -110.5, lat = 27, zoom = 6)

```

### 3.6. Predicted Historical Sex Ratios

Using our model, we predicted historical sex ratios based on LGM suitability estimates, displayed in an interactive map (Figure 4). A correlation test indicated a significant relationship (r = 0.48, p = 0.003), suggesting that higher LGM suitability regions had higher predicted sex ratios.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Question 6
# Figure 7
ggplot(locations_joined, aes(x = Suitability_LGM, y = predicted_sex_ratio_lgm)) +
 geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +  # Adds a regression line
  labs(title = "Predicted Historical Sex Ratio vs LGM Suitability",
       x = "LGM Suitability", y = "Predicted Historical Sex Ratio") +
  theme_minimal()
```

<center>

Figure 7. The figure displays the predicted historical sex ratio versus LGM suitability, demonstrating a significant negative correlation.

<center>

### 3.7. Spatial Autocorrelation in Historical Sex Ratios

Finally, a Moran’s I test showed significant spatial autocorrelation in predicted historical sex ratios (Moran's I = 0.9879, p \< 0.001), indicating that neighboring sites had similar ratios due to shared environmental and climatic influences.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
locations_joined_clean <- locations_joined %>%
  filter(!is.na(predicted_sex_ratio_lgm))
# Figure 9
leaflet(locations_joined_clean) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addCircleMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude, 
    radius = 6, 
    color = ~colorNumeric("RdYlBu", predicted_sex_ratio_lgm)(predicted_sex_ratio_lgm),
    stroke = FALSE, 
    fillOpacity = 0.8, 
    popup = ~paste("Site:", Site, "<br>", "Predicted Sex Ratio (LGM):", predicted_sex_ratio_lgm) 
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    position = "bottomright",  
    pal = colorNumeric("RdYlBu", locations_joined_clean$predicted_sex_ratio_lgm),
    values = locations_joined_clean$predicted_sex_ratio_lgm,  
    title = "Predicted Sex Ratio (LGM)"
  ) %>%
  setView(lng = -110.5, lat = 27, zoom = 6)

## 4. Discussion

This study examines the relationship between habitat suitability, sex ratio, and phenotypic traits in populations of *A. attenuatus*. We observed variations in sex ratios across different sites, finding a significant correlation between habitat quality and the average sex ratio. This supports the idea that better-quality habitats tend to attract more females.

By incorporating phenotypic traits into our analysis, we enhanced our understanding of these variations, suggesting that these traits influence individual success and reproductive outcomes. Our historical analysis indicated that changes in habitat suitability since the Last Glacial Maximum have likely impacted population structure and genetic diversity.

Additionally, our findings identified spatial autocorrelation in predicted sex ratios, suggesting that nearby sites often exhibit similar ratios due to shared environmental factors. These insights are important for forest management and pest control strategies, particularly regarding the effects of *A. attenuatus* on pine forests.

In summary, this study underscores the complex interactions among habitat, sex ratios, and phenotypic traits in *A. attenuatus*, highlighting the need for further research to guide effective management in the face of climate change.
