## Overview & Objective

This is the first foray into how to actually use `R` and focuses on understanding some of the most basic data types.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  

 - Describe characteristics of numeric, character, logical, and date data types.  
 - Use introspection and coercion for basic data types. 
 - Perform operations on included data types.  


## Activity

The following markdown has a set of questions followed by a chunk for you to put in code to answer the question.  Fill them all out as indicated.


### Numeric Data

What is your favorite number

```{r}
MyFavoriteNumber <- 3
MyFavoriteNumber

```


The ancient Egyptians were quite cleaver at engineering and building things.  The [Rhind Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus), which dates to 1650 BCE, indicates that they estimated the ratio between the circumfrence and the diameter of a circle to be 256 divided by 81.  Mathematically is this more or less than what we estimate $\pi$ as?  What is the magnitude of the difference?

```{r}
pi
ePi <- 256/81
ePi

#ePi is greater then Pi (3.16 > 3.14)
```



The function `sqrt()` provides you the square root of a number. Assign a variable named `root2` to hold the value of `sqrt(2)`.

```{r}
root2 <- sqrt(2)
root2
```


What is the value contained in the variable below named `sqrOfNegative2`?  Explain the result and make any modifications necessary to be more explicit.

```{r}
sqrOfNegative2 <- (-2)^2 #-2^2 = -4 because of the order of operations
sqrOfNegative2
```



### Character Data

Create variables for your first and last names (and give them proper variable names).

```{r}
First <- "Rebecca"
Last <- "Hoover"

First
Last

```


Use the functions `print()` and `cat()` to display these values.  Are these two functions identical?

```{r}
print(First)
cat(Last)
```


Create a new variable, `properName`, which is your last name, a commma and space, followed by your first name.  Use the variables above instead of writing out the letters for your names.

```{r}
properName <- paste (First, Last)
properName
```


The function `nchar()` returns the number of characters in a character variable.  Use it on your `properName`.

```{r}

```


### Logical Data 

Create the variables `trueResult` and `falseResult` and assign them the proper logical values for R.

```{r}
trueResult <- TRUE
falseResult <- FALSE
```


Using the variables `trueResult` and `falseResult` demonstrate logical operators for equality, inequality, and negation.

```{r}
trueResult == falseResult 
trueResult != falseResult

!trueResult
!falseResult
```


Using the variables `trueResult` and `falseResult` demonstrate AND operator in R for all pairwise combinations (e.g, for the and operator, show how to evaluate `trueResult` and `trueResult`, `trueResult` and `falseResult`, `falseResult` and `trueResult`, and `falseResult` and `falseResult`)

```{r}
trueResult | falseResult


```

Do the same as the previous question for the approriate OR operator.

```{r}

```




In the example above for the square root, the variable `root2` has the square root of the number $2$.  Test the equality (e.g., use the `==` operator) of this varible times itself to the value $2$. Discuss this with your neighbor.  Does this make sense?

```{r}
root
```



### Dates


When did you first become a college student?  Create a variable representing this date.

```{r}

```


How many days was it between then and now?

```{r}

```
